<h3>Erlang-C formula</h3>

<p>
By using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlang_distribution">Erlang-C formula</a>
the relevant performance indicators can be calculated exactly. In this context "simple" means the model needs
to have the following properties:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>The inter-arrival times are exponential distributed.</li>
  <li>The service times are exponential distributed.</li>
  <li>There is a fixed number of operators.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The classical Erlang-C formula cannot represent clients impatience.
But the extended Erlang-C formula can represent impatience, so the
following property may also prevail in a simple model:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Optionally, clients are only willing to wait for a limited time. If this is the case,
  it waiting time tolerance has to be exponential distributed.</li>
</ul>

<p>
A corresponding model is then called <b>M/M/c</b> or <b>M/M/c/ infinity+M</b> model.
</p>

<h3>Allen-Cunneen approximation formula</h3>

<p>
The Allen-Cunneen approximation formula allows a relaxation of the restrictions defined
in the Erlang-C model: Instead of exponentially distributed inter-arrival and service times,
<b>any distributions</b> characterized by their expected value and coefficient of variation
are now allowed. 
For this, the absolute accuracy has to be
given up, i.e. even with a model which complies with all specifications of the Allen-Cunneen
approximation formula, differences between the approximation formula results and the
simulation reality have to be expected.
