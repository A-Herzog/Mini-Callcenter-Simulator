<p>
An inter-arrival time is the time span <b>between the arrival</b> of
two immediately consecutive clients at the system.
<a href="help:statistik_mittelwert">Average value</a>,
<a href="help:statistik_standardabweichung">standard deviation</a> and
<a href="help:statistik_CV">coefficients of variation</a> are displayed.
</p>

<p>
The average inter-arrival time is designated by <b>E[I]</b>
(and is measured in seconds). The
reciprocal of E[I] is the <b>arrival rate</b>. It is
designated by <b>lambda</b> (&lambda;) (measured in 1/second).
Small values of E[I] or large values
of lambda mean that many clients arrive within a short time.
