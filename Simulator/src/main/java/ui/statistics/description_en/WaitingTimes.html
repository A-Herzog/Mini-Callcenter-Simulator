<p>
On this statistics page, information on the waiting times of the clients is displayed.
A distinction is made between the waiting times of successful clients and the waiting
times of the waiting cancelers (i.e. the cancelation times). In both cases
<a href="help:statistik_mittelwert">average values</a>,
<a href="help:statistik_standardabweichung">standard deviations</a> and
<a href="help:statistik_CV">coefficients of variations</a> are displayed.
</p>

<h3>Service level</h3>

<p>
In addition, the service level is output at the 20 second threshold.
This value indicates the proportion of clients who had to wait a maximum
of 20 seconds.
</p>

<p>
Since the service level is closely related to the
<a href="help:statistik_quantil">quantiles</a>,
the quantiles of the waiting times are also output in this section.
