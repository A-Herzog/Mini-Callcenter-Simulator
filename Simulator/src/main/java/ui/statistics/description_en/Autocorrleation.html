The value <b>min{k|rho(k)&lt;10%}</b> mean: The smallest distance <b>k</b> from which
on the remaining autocorrelation <b>rho(k)</b> is less than 10%. Usually a remaining
autocorrelation of 5% is accepted for the calculation of confidence intervals, i.e.
the value output at <b>min{k|rho(k)&lt;5%}</b> is used.
