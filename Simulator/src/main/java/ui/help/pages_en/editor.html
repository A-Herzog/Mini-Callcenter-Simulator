<h1>Modell editor</h1>

<p>
The model editor consists of 7 pages where all parameters of the call center model to be simulated can be set:
</p>

<h2>Model <img src="../images/Symbol.png"></h2>

<p>
No settings can be made on this page, only the simulation model shown in the simulator is displayed.
</p>

<p>
In the simulation the following properties of a real queueing or call center system can be represented:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Any type for the inter-arrival times distribution</li>
  <li>Batch arrivals</li>
  <li>Waiting room limitations</li>
  <li>Limited waiting time tolerances of the clients</li>
  <li>Retry probabilities and retry distances of the waiting cancelers</li>
  <li>Any number of agents</li>
  <li>Any type for the service times distribution</li>
  <li>Batch service</li>
  <li>Forwarding probability after serving a client</li>
</ul>

<p>
However, the Mini Callcenter Simulator cannot represent the following
relevant properties of a real call center system:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Transient phase, i.e. change in arrival rate and number of agents over the day</li>
  <li>Different client types with different properties</li>
  <li>Different agent types with different skills</li>
  <li>Priority rules for client and agents groups</li>
</ul>

<p>
The commercial call center simulator is able to represent all of these properties
and also has much more comprehensive tools for evaluation of simulation runs and
semi-automatic optimization of call center systems.
</p>

<h2>General <img src="../images/brick.png"></h2>

<p>
On the "General" page, you can enter a <b>name</b> and a <b>description</b> for the model.
These data are not used in the simulation but are stored together with the model and
together with the statistical results, so that its possible to understand what should
be investigated with the respective model later.
</p>

<p>
The field <b>Calls to simulate</b> can be used to set how many virtual clients are to be considered in the simulation.
The higher the number, the less the simulation results fluctuate but also the longer the simulation takes.
Since the simulation is supposed to represent the stationary phase of the queueing system, a warm-upphase is
inserted before counting the calls and collecting statistical results. The transient phase lasts 10% as long as
the later actual simulation.
</p>

<h2>Arrivals <img src="../images/user.png"></h2>

<p>
On the "Arrivals" page, the field <b>Clients per arrival</b> can be used to specify how many clients will
arrive per arrival event. If you want to model a call center system where clients arrive individually,
you can leave this value at 1. Using the <b>inter-arrival times</b> distribution editor, you can define
the interval between arrivals. If clients arrive in a system without noticing each other's arrivals
(as is the case in a call center system, for example), the exponential distribution is suitable for
modeling the inter-arrival times.
</p>

<h2>Waiting room and waiting time tolerance <img src="../images/door_in.png"></h2>

<p>
The <b>waiting room limitation</b> can be used to set the maximum number of clients that
can be in the queue at the same time. Clients who are already being served do not occupy
any space in the queue, that is, a waiting room limit only refers to waiting clients.
If a client arrives and no free waiting space is available, the client is rejected and
immediately leaves the system. He is recorded as a waiting canceller with a waiting time
of 0 seconds. Just as clients who have given up waiting due to the waiting time limitation,
a rejected caller can also possibly start another call attempt later.
</p>

<p>
If the clients have only have a limited <b> waiting time tolerance</b>, clients stop waiting (and hang up,
e.g. in the case of a call center) if their individual waiting time tolerance is exceeded. The waiting
time tolerance is not a constant value for all clients, but is determined individually per client according
to the waiting time tolerance distribution set in the distribution editor on this page.
The wait time tolerance distribution can have very different distribution types and
is usually difficult to determine in practice.
</p>

<h2>Service <img src="../images/group.png"></h2>

<p>
On the "Service" page, all parameters relevant to the service process can be set.
The input field <b>Number of agents</b> can be used to define how many agents work in parallel in the system and serve clients.
</p>

<p>
In the call center area, each agent usually processes one client at a time; in the context of more general service systems
(usually in an industrial environment), however, one operator may be able to process several requests at the same time.
If an operator should always handle several requests simultaneously, this can be defined by a value greater than 1 in the field
<b>Clients per service batch</b>. If a value greater than 1 is stored here and a single client arrives in an empty system,
the operator must wait until enough additional clients have arrived to reach the required service batch size.
</p>

<p>
The distribution editor for the <b>service times</b> can be used to define how long the individual service processes should last.
In practice, log-normal distributions or gamma distributions are often useful for modeling call times.
</p> 

<p>
After a conversation, it may be necessary to direct the client to another agent to finalize his request.
The percentage of served callers to be forwarded after a call can be defined in the input field <b>Forwarding probability</b>.
</p>

<h2>Post-processing <img src="../images/server_go.png"></h2>

<p>
On the "Post-processing" page, a distribution can be set for the amount of time an agent
needs after a conversation with a client before he/she reports as available again.
</p>

<p>
The client has already left the system or has already been forwarded when the agent starts the post-processing time.
This means that the post-processing time cannot be counted as service time for the client. On the other hand, however,
the agent is still occupied by the work associated to the client during the post-processing time, so that he or she is
not yet available for new calls during this time. This means that the post-processing time cannot be counted as the
agent's availability time either.
</p> 

<h2>Retry <img src="../images/arrow_redo2.png"></h2>

<p>
A client who was either rejected due to the fact that all waiting places were occupied or who gave up waiting prematurely
due to an individual waiting time tolerance that was too short, can later start another call attempt.
Via the input field <b>Retry probability</b> you can define the probability for this.
</p>

<p>
If a client decides to make another call attempt later, he will wait a certain amount of time before making the further call attempt.
Using the distribution editor for defining the <b>Retry distances</b>, you can set the probability distribution according to which
the individual repeat intervals should be defined.
