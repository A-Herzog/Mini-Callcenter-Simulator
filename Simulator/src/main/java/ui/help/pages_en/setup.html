<h1>Settings</h1>

<p>
The settings dialog consists of 4 dialog pages, which are used to configure
the operating parameters of the simulator:
</p>

<h2>User interface <img src="../images/application_go.png"></h2>
<p>
On this dialog page the appearance and behavior of the simulators
user interface can be set:
</p>

<h3>Program language</h3>
<p>
In the field can be select whether the program interface should be displayed in English or in German.
<br>(If German is selected as the system language, the default value is "German", otherwise it is "English".)
</p>

<h3>Window size on program start</h3>
<p>
In this selection field, you can set how the program window should look at the start of the simulator.
In addition to "Default window size" and "Full screen", the option "Restore last window size" provides
the option to save the window size at the end of the program and restore it at the next startup.
<br>(Default value for this option: "Default window size".)
</p>

<h3>Theme</h3>
<p>
In Java (depending on the used operating system) different themes for styling the graphical
program interface are available. This field can be used to select the theme to be used.
</p>
<p>
(The default is "System default", i.e. styling the program in the form intended for native programs.)
</p>

<h3>Menu in window title</h3>
<p>
In one of the flat themes is selected and if the simulator is running under Windows 10, the main menu
can be integrated directly into the title bar. If this option is activated, this integration takes place
and there is accordingly an additional line of space available for the model in the program window.
If the simulator is run under an operating system other than Windows 10 or if none of the flat themes
is selected, this option has no meaning.
</p>
<p>
(This option is enabled by default.)
</p>

<h2>Graphics <img src="../images/image.gif"></h2>

<h3>Resolution when saving images</h3>
<p>
In this field can be specified which resolution should be used in pixels
both in the horizontal and in the vertical direction when storing graphics
from the statistics results as pixel graphics.
<br>(Default value is 1000 pixels.)
</p>

<h2>Simulation <img src="../images/action_go.gif"></h2>

<h3>Use all CPU cores</h3>
<p>
If this option is selected, all CPU cores will be used for calculation during simulation.
If its disabled, only one core is used, this means the simulation will be significantly slower.
<br>(By default this option is activated.)
</p>

<h2>Statistics <img src="../images/sum2.png"></h2>

<h3>Open texts and tables</h3>
<p>
In this selection fields you can set up which external programs should be
offered for transferring the data from the statistics text and table pages.
<br>(As default Word and Excel are selected.)
