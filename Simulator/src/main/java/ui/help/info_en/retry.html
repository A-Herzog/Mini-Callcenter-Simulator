<h1>Retry</h1>

<p>
A client who was either rejected due to the fact that all waiting places were occupied or who gave up waiting prematurely
due to an individual waiting time tolerance that was too short, can later start another call attempt.
Via the input field <b>Retry probability</b> you can define the probability for this.
</p>

<p>
If a client decides to make another call attempt later, he will wait a certain amount of time before making the further call attempt.
Using the distribution editor for defining the <b>Retry distances</b>, you can set the probability distribution according to which
the individual repeat intervals should be defined.
