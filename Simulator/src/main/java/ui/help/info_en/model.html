<h1>Model</h1>

<p>
This page shows the general design of the simulation model:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Clients arrive and line up in the queue - or are rejected if there is no more room in the queue.</li>
  <li>Waiting clients may give up waiting if their personal waiting time tolerance is exceeded.</li>
  <li>Clients who leave the queue without having been served may try again later.</li>
  <li>If an agent becomes free, the service of the next waiting client is started.</li>
  <li>After serving a client, an agent may go into an additional post-processing period before reporting as available again.</li>
  <li>Clients will leave the system after being served or will be referred back to the queue if their request has not been completely clarified.</li> 
</ul>
