<h1>Waiting room and waiting time tolerance</h1>

<p>
If the size of the <b>waiting room</b> is limited, clients arriving while
all waiting places are occupied will be rejected. Clients who are already
being served do not occupy any space in the queue, i.e. a waiting room
limitation only applies to waiting clients.
</p>

<p>
The <b>waiting time tolerance</b> can be used to control whether clients are
willing to wait as long as needed or whether they will give up waiting at some
point. The waiting time tolerance is not a constant value for all clients, but
is determined individually for each client according to the set distribution.
</p>

<p>
Recording the <b>autocorrelation of waiting times</b> slows down the simulation,
but allows to see how strong the influence of one client's waiting time is on
the waiting times of the following clients.
