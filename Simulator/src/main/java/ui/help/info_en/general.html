<h1>General</h1>

<p>
The <b>name</b> and the <b>description</b> are only used for the later identification
of the model and have no effect on the simulation. Both are free text fields.
</p>

<p>
For the number of <b>call to simulate</b>, a higher number leads to statistically
more stable results, but also extends the simulation time.
