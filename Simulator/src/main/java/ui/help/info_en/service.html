<h1>Service</h1>

<p>
The <b>number of agents</b> indicates how many agents work at the workstation simultaneously.
</p>

<p>
In the classic call center area, one agent talks to one client at a time. In other areas,
however, it may be the case that several <b>clients are served per service batch</b>.
</p>

<p>
The individual service times of the clients are determined via the <b>service time distribution</b>.
While the exponential distribution was often appropriate for inter-arrival times, service times are
rarely exponentially distributed. More common are the lognormal or the gamma distribution.
</p>

<p>
After a conversation, it may be necessary to direct the client to another agent in order to finalize
his request. The percentage of served callers to be forwarded after a call can be defined via the
input field <b>Forwarding probability</b>.
