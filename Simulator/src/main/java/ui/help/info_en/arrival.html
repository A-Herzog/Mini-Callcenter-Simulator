<h1>Arrivals</h1>

<p>
If the clients arrive individually (which is the normal case in a call center),
the value in the field <b>clients per arrival</b> can be left at 1. If several
clients arrive at the same time, a higher value can be entered here.
</p>

<p>
The <b>distribution of the inter-arrival times</b> determines the intervals
between the arrival of the clients. In addition to the average distance between
arrivals, the distribution also controls the variation of arrivals.
If the clients arrive independently, the exponential distribution is the
right choice due to its memorylessness.
